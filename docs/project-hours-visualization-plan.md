# Project Hours Visualization Plan

## Summary
Enhance the existing project hours visualization to provide users with better insights into their time allocation across projects. The visualization will help users track trends, identify workload patterns, and optimize their time management.

## Current Implementation
We currently have a `ProjectLineChart` component that provides:
- Line chart showing hours per project per week
- Interactive tooltips with detailed breakdowns
- Project line toggling
- Weekly total hours display
- Responsive design
- Color-coded project lines
- Week range display with dates

## Problem Statement
While the current implementation is solid, users need:
1. Better filtering capabilities for date ranges
2. More intuitive project selection
3. Enhanced analytics for time patterns
4. Improved mobile experience
5. Better data aggregation views

## Proposed Enhancements

### 1. Core Visualization Improvements
- [ ] Add date range picker for flexible time window selection
- [ ] Implement zoom/pan controls for longer time periods
- [ ] Add option to switch between line and bar chart views
- [ ] Enhance tooltip information with percentage breakdowns
- [ ] Add trend lines for project hour averages

### 2. Project Selection & Filtering
- [ ] Create a more intuitive project selection interface
- [ ] Add search/filter for projects when many exist
- [ ] Group related projects together
- [ ] Add quick filters for common time ranges (Last month, Quarter, Year)
- [ ] Save user preferences for default view

### 3. Analytics Enhancements
- [ ] Add total hours summary for selected period
- [ ] Show week-over-week changes
- [ ] Highlight peaks and valleys in time allocation
- [ ] Calculate and display project time distribution
- [ ] Add export functionality for data (CSV/Excel)

### 4. Mobile Optimizations
- [ ] Optimize touch interactions for the chart
- [ ] Improve project toggle UI for small screens
- [ ] Enhanced mobile tooltips
- [ ] Responsive layout adjustments
- [ ] Gesture support for zoom/pan

### 5. Performance Improvements
- [ ] Implement data windowing for large datasets
- [ ] Optimize render performance
- [ ] Add loading states
- [ ] Cache frequently accessed data
- [ ] Lazy load historical data

## Success Metrics
1. **Usage Metrics**
   - 70%+ of users with >3 submissions view the visualization
   - Average time spent analyzing data increases by 20%
   - 50%+ of users use filtering features

2. **Performance Metrics**
   - Initial render under 200ms for 6 months of data
   - Smooth interactions (60fps) during chart manipulation
   - Mobile load time under 300ms

3. **User Satisfaction**
   - Less than 5% reported confusion
   - 80%+ positive feedback on new features
   - Reduction in support tickets about time tracking

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Improvements
1. Implement date range picker
2. Add chart type toggle
3. Enhance tooltips
4. Improve project selection UI

### Phase 2: Analytics & Export
1. Add summary statistics
2. Implement trend analysis
3. Add data export functionality
4. Create aggregated views

### Phase 3: Mobile & Performance
1. Mobile UI optimizations
2. Touch interaction improvements
3. Performance optimizations
4. Data windowing implementation

### Phase 4: Polish & Refinement
1. User feedback incorporation
2. UI/UX refinements
3. Performance tuning
4. Bug fixes and optimizations

## Technical Considerations

### Components
```typescript
interface ChartDataPoint {
  week: number;
  [projectName: string]: number | string;
}

interface WeekMeta {
  start_date: string;
  end_date: string;
}

// New components needed:
- DateRangePicker
- ChartTypeToggle
- ProjectSelector
- TrendAnalysis
- ExportPanel
```

### Libraries
- Recharts (existing)
- date-fns for date manipulation
- react-window for data windowing
- react-query for data management

### State Management
- Local component state for UI
- Context for user preferences
- Cache for historical data

## Next Steps
1. Review and prioritize enhancements
2. Create detailed technical specifications
3. Design new UI components
4. Begin Phase 1 implementation
5. Set up tracking for success metrics

## Future Considerations
- AI-powered insights
- Team-level visualizations
- Custom chart types
- Integration with project management tools
- Automated reporting
