# AI Daily Pulse Assistant Demo Feature Summary

## Overview
This feature provides an AI-powered workflow for quickly logging daily work tasks using natural language, with a modern, user-friendly interface for review and editing.

## Key Features
- **AI Assistant Input:**
  - Users enter free-text descriptions of tasks (e.g., "Fixed login bug @project-alpha #bugfix 1.5h").
  - Multiple tasks can be entered at once, each on a new line.
  - The AI parses the input and extracts structured data: date, project, bucket/type, hours, and description.

- **Task Grouping & Display:**
  - Parsed tasks are grouped by date.
  - Each date section displays a summary of all tasks for that day, including total hours.
  - Each task shows hours, description, project, and bucket/type in a compact card layout.

- **Editing Workflow:**
  - Tasks can be edited inline by clicking "Edit"; the edit form appears in a side column.
  - Edits are saved back to the summary view.
  - New parses add tasks to the existing list (do not overwrite).

- **Responsive Layout:**
  - Summary and edit form are shown side-by-side on desktop, stacked on mobile.

## Usage Flow
1. User enters one or more task descriptions in the AI Assistant section.
2. AI parses and adds tasks to the summary, grouped by date.
3. User can review, edit, and save any task.
4. All tasks remain visible and editable until cleared or submitted.

## Example Input
